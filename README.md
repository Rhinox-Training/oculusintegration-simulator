# SETUP

## Setting up the Simulator
You can either use the **OVRCameraRig** Variant which has the simulator included, this you can just drag into your scene.  
you can also use the normal **OVRCameraRig** and then attach the simulator prefab under it afterwards.

**OVRCameraRig** with Simulator prefab attached

In the OclulusSimulator prefab you have 3 scripts attached.  
The first script is `OculusDeviceSimulatorControls`

This script takes all the Input actions to:
- move the headset and contollers.
- change the space to either: local, parent or screenspace.
- change which controller's buttons you are manipulating. 

The 2 scripts below that are the simulator logic itself and a small script to enable the input actions.

#### NOTE
When adding the simulator prefab to an existing OVRCamerageRig then you must link the `CenterEyeAnchor` transform from the OVRCameraRig into the `Camera Transform` slot.


## Setting up the Recorder/Playback

Drag the `RecorderPlayback` prefab onto the **OVRCameraRig**.

### Recorder Settings

Under `Device Transforms`

Link the following:
- `Simulator` needs the `OculusSimulator` Script.
- `Head Transform` needs the `CenterEyeAnchor` from the **OVRCameraRig**.
- `Left Hand Transform` needs the `LeftHandAnchor` from the **OVRCameraRig**.
- `Right Hand Transform` needs the `RightHandAnchor` from the **OVRCameraRig**.

### Playback Settings

The PlaybackScript under the `RecorderPlayback` only needs the `OculusSimulator` Script linked in the `Simulator` slot under the Input Parameters.

## Setting up the Input Visualizer

The Input Visualizer can just be placed in the scene, but the follwing things need to be linked.

![Input Visualizer](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/76707656/221597541-e3bee99b-dce6-49c7-8043-6f380652f999.png)

Link the following:
- `Device Simulator Controls` needs the `OculusSimulator (Oculus Device Simulator Controls)` Script.
- `Device Simulator` needs the `OculusSimulator (Oculus Device Simulator)` Script.
- `Recorder` needs the `Recorder` Script.
- `Playback` needs the `Playback` Script.

# USAGE

## The Simulator

## The Recorder/Playback

![Recorder](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/76707656/221591706-a1ab8b98-a1c5-47fe-bca2-c336f7948c41.png)

First you need to select the Output Directory for the recordings, otherwise the recordings cannot be saved.

Below this is the name of the recording file, the textfield is to give in a new name for the recording and the dropdown menu right below it is to select an existing file to overwrite it.

##### Recording Parameters
- `Start on Awake` will start the recording with the chosen name when the session is started.
- `End on Destroy` will stop the recording with the chosen name when the session is ended.

When setting the desired fps of the recording, also change the deadzones. The higher the desired fps, the lower the deadzone values should be. These values might take some trial and error to match perfectly. Some reference fps and thir deadzone value (positional deadzone and rotational deadzone are the same here): -120 fps -> 0.001

75 fps -> 0.002
60 fps -> 0.005
30 fps -> 0.05
1 fps -> 0.1
